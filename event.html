        <h3>Community Care Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            You need my awareness, not campaign to keep your country clean.  Ten stick means one, you know? Let's be aware of how to keep the country clean.  Your environment will be beautiful if you put the garbage in the dustbin instead of throwing it away.  By doing this, the cleaning staff can take the garbage from a certain place. If there is no dustbin, dig a hole in the ground and fill it with soil.  Our Ashraf Excellence Center kids go to different points of the area on a particular day of the week and inspire people to keep the environment clean.  Garbage is asked to be thrown at a specific place. They give priority to places near mosques, schools and markets and make people aware of these issues.
